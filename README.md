### Deploy to GitHub Pages (CI)

This repo includes a GitHub Actions workflow that builds the app and publishes the `dist/` directory to the `gh-pages` branch.

- Workflow: `.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml` (trigger: push to `main`)
- The workflow sets the published CNAME to `nexax.global` so the site will be available at `https://nexax.global`.

Notes:

- The project uses a SPA routing strategy; the `postbuild` script copies `dist/index.html` to `dist/404.html` so client-side routing works on GitHub Pages.
- Make sure DNS for `nexax.global` points to GitHub Pages. For apex domains add the following A records:

	- 185.199.108.153
	- 185.199.109.153
	- 185.199.110.153
	- 185.199.111.153

If you prefer a PR instead of direct commits, tell me and I will open a branch for review.
